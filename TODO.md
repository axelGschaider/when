Multi Day Support
=================
not decided on format yet. But I want to be able to give an end date.


Date Parameter For 'when e'
===========================
usefull for external scripts. When the date parameter is given the date is injected as first line. So you can start editing right away.


Interactive Mode
================
move between days.
hjkl as expected
m one month forth
M one month back
y one year forth
Y one year back
i insert event at selected date (can be done by date parameter)



Coloring
========
differnt color for different cal files?
